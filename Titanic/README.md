# Kaggle Titanic Competition
This is my Kaggle competition. It is very famous and beginner competition on Kaggle. This is a machine learning classification problem, and, in this competition, the famous titanic data is used to predict the if someone survived or not. I used five different machine learning classification techniques in this competition and then compare it each other. The techniques used were Logistic regression, Random Forest classifier, Gradient boosting classifier, Decision tree classifier and Gaussian naive bayes classifier. The Decision tree was the best model with the model accuracy of 97%.
